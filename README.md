# eLibrary Project

A favourite place for book lovers to buy books.
This project is developed using React and React Router. The website has a functional navigation system with dynamic routing, allowing users to move between different pages seamlessly.

The homepage has mainly 4 sections.

1. Navbar
2. Banner
3. Book display in cards
4. Footer

When users clicks on a book card it redirects to book details page.

The details page has two buttons; Add to Read and Add to Cart.
When any of that button is clicked a toast appears.

A custom 404 error page is added for convenience.
